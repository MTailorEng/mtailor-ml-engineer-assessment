# Design and Train an object detector to detect objects

You have to design and implement a Training Pipeline that can train, test and visualize the model using the dataset provided.

## Assignment Protocols

- You will be given 6 hours at max to complete this assessment
- You need to use Google Collaboratory to run this notebook
- You can only use Python as a programming Language
- Once you start you have to complete this assessment in those 6 hours, it cannot be paused and resumed later
- You cannot take help from any other person
- You can use Google to search for references
- You can not search on google for design-related things, like what should be loss function, or what should be model architecture.
  - But you can use pre-trained backbones from PyTorch
- [NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED WITHOUT THESE VIDEOS] Record videos for the whole duration of the assessment:
  - Make sure you start screen recording before starting the assessment and submit the screen recording link after you are done with the assessment
    - Make sure to add a detailed walk-through of the codebase you have developed in the screen recording
      - Sharing implementation details, giving a full overview of the codebase
      - Explain Design Decisions related to:
        - Model Architecture
        - Loss Function
        - Dataloader
        - etc.
  - Make sure you record yourself while doing the assignment, you can do this either using a laptop camera or you can use a mobile phone to make your video.
  - The two recordings should be easily downloadable and should require no authentication.
  - The candidate will be rejected if there are no videos submitted.

## Task Details
Design a Training Pipeline to train a object detector with following specs or assumptions:
- Implement & Design Model
  - You can use any backbone
    - Either from PyTorch (torhvision) or any resource online
    - But you need to design head your self (head means how you will use features of the back bone and get the desired outputs)
  - Model needs to detect one object in each image
  - Model should output following for each image passed as input:
    - Whether we have an object or not
    - Where is the object?
      - The bounding box output format should be xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax
      - It is not necessary the model is trained to output exactly this format but the visualize function which shows output should output in this format
    - Either the object is a cat or dog?
    - And which specie the object belongs to? There are in total 9 species: 
      - Cat [3 species]:
        - Abyssinian
        - Birman
        - Persian
      - Dog [6 species]
        - american_bulldog
        - american_pit_bull_terrier
        - basset_hound
        - beagle
        - chihuahua
        - pomeranian
- Implement Custom Dataloader
  - This is obvious as dataset is in a unique format any predifined dataloader wont work
  - Follow best practices of writing custom dataloaders
  - Details of the format of the dataset are defined in the Dataset Details section below
  - Add needed pre-processing that you think would help train a better model or would help as we are using pre-trained weights as starting point
  - Add augmentations that you think would help train a better model
- Implement Loss Function
  - Design and implement a loss function that can handle all of the outputs we have
  - You can use pytorch built-in loss functions
  - There are many scenarios which you need to handle, which one can understand from the dataset details and the model design
- Implement Test Function
  - The test function should be able to run the model on the validation set and output the metrics for all the outputs of the model
  - Select the metrics carefully, there are many scenarios which can change the selection of a metric
  - Keep in mind there are multiple outputs, you would need a metric for each output
- Update Resume Training Functionality using the best weights
  - Current script does not have best weights save functionality
  - The code should be able to resume training from exactly same point from where the training was stopped if model weights file is passed
  - Keep in mind you can not resume training from same point by just loading weights of the model
- Implement a visualize function
  - The input of the function should be path of a folder with images and the weight file
    - Also the output folder path to save outputs
  - This function should return a dictionary of dictionaries with following details for each image:
    - {
        "has_object": True,
        "cat_or_dog": "cat",
        "specie": "persian",
        "xmin": 10,
        "ymin": 10,
        "xmax": 10,
        "ymax": 10
    }
  - And in case there is no object it should have 0 for bbox values, "NA" for "cat_or_dog" and "specie", and False for "has_object".
  - Values of the returned dictionary should be like explained above and keys should be image names including the extension ".jpg" or ".jpeg"
  - Should save output image with bounding box drawn on it, with same name input image but place in the output folder 
- Implement Test Cases to Test Different Functions Written
  - Work on this part in the end if you have time
  - If you have limited time write in words, how and what you would have tested if you had time


## Dataset Details
The dataset has in total 1041 images. Each image has a single object which is either a cat or a dog.
- There are multiple species for both cat and dog.
- The number of images falling in each specie is as follows:
  - basset_hound: 93
  - Birman: 93
  - pomeranian: 93
  - american_pit_bull_terrier: 93
  - american_bulldog: 93
  - Abyssinian: 92
  - beagle: 93
  - Persian: 93
  - chihuahua: 93
  - empty: 142
- The dataset has two folders:
  - images
    - Inside images folder we have 986 images in .jpg folder
  - labels
    - Inside labels folder we have 899 .xml files each file with details of image labels
    - For any image that does not have a cat or dog, there is no corresponding xml file

## Deliverable
- Updated Colab Based Jupyter Notebook:
  - With all the required functionality Implemented
  - Which one can train the model without any errors
  - One should achieve same metrics (Almost same metrics) if I run training using this collab notebook
    - Set default values for everything accordingly, during evaluation we will just run the notebook and use the best weights the notebook saves automatically
- Best weights you have trained
  - We will Evaluate you weights against hold-out test we have and compare results
  - We will use visualize function to generate outputs for each image
  - Upload weights in an easily downloadable location like, Dropbox, Google Drive, Github, etc
- Video Explaining your design decisions
  - Model Design which layers and activation functions you used and why
  - Loss function, which loss functions you used and why
  - How you implemented resume functionality, what were the things you thought would be needed to resume training from exact same point


## Evaluation Criteria
 - Design Decisions
 - Completeness: Did you include all features?
 - Correctness: Does the solution (all deliverables) work in sensible, thought-out ways?
 - Maintainability: Is the code written in a clean, maintainable way?
 - Testing: Is the solution adequately tested?
 - Documentation: Is the codebase well-documented and has proper steps to run any of the deliverables?

## Extra Points
- Model Design should handle any input size
  - Model should not be designed in a way that it can only accept a fixed input size.
- Any Updates in the notebook (Bugs/Implementation Mistakes etc)
